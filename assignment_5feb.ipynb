    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1)Abstraction: This refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and showing only the necessary information to the user. This helps to simplify the complexity of the system and improve its overall readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)Encapsulation: This refers to the process of wrapping data and functions within an object, so that the internal details of an object are protected and can only be accessed through well-defined interfaces. This helps to prevent unintended modifications to the internal state of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3)Inheritance: This refers to the ability of an object to inherit properties and behavior from its parent object. This allows for the creation of new objects that are based on existing objects, and helps to reduce the amount of redundant code in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4)Polymorphism: This refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class, making it possible to write generic algorithms that can work with objects of d"
